There are multiple roles: Admin, Technician, Client and Analyst.
The first user to register on the website automatically gets admin rights. Every user to register after that gets default client access.
Admins can access a special admin panel from where they can manage everything regarding the website and its users.
Technician fields are created and assigned to technicians by the admins.
Technicians are assigned by admins and can access a special page only for technicians where they can manage their appointments.
One technician can be assigned to multiple fields and one field can have multiple technicians assigned to it.
Clients have access to a page where they can enter their vehicle's details and choose date and time to make an appointment to a given technician.
One technician can have multiple vehicles assigned to them and one vehicle can be assigned to multiple technicians.
When the selected technician approves the appointment clients are not allowed to make any changes to the approved appointment.
The vehicle which is linked to the approved appointment has its 'status' field set to 'true' meaning no more changes are allowed to the appointment.
Clients can see in what state their vehicle appointment is in (waiting, processing, done) but cannot make any changes to the specific appointment.
Admins can also give Analyst role to users which would allow those users to access the 'User Distribution' & 'Field Distribution' pages in read-only mode.
Admins can access all pages regardless of any restrictions that would normally apply.
